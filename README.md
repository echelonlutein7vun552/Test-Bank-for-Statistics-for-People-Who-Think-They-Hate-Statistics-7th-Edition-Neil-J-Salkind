  * The bestselling Statistics for People Who (Think They) Hate Statistics is now in its Seventh Edition with new co-author Bruce B. Frey. This text teaches an often intimidating and difficult subject in a way that is informative, personable, and clear. The authors take students through various statistical procedures, beginning with correlation and graphical representation of data and ending with inferential techniques and analysis of variance. In addition, the text provides instruction in SPSS, and includes reviews of more advanced techniques, such as reliability, validity, introductory non-parametric statistics, and more. The text includes a key feature called ""The Path to Wisdom and Knowledge"": a flowchart in each of the main chapters showing readers how to select the appropriate test statistic. The new edition includes more on multiple regression, power and effect size, and a new feature on statisticians throughout history called ""People Who Loved Statistics"". Retaining the student-friendly tone and presentation that made this text an international bestseller, new co-author Bruce Frey has added new examples, and reworked or expanded the explanations of many concepts to provide extra clarity.
